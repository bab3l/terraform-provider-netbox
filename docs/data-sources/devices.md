# netbox_devices (Data Source)

Query devices in NetBox using AWS-style filter blocks. Multiple `filter` blocks are ANDed; values within a filter are ORed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "netbox_devices" "by_name" {
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["my-device-01"]
  }
}

output "device_ids" {
  value = data.netbox_devices.by_name.ids
}
```
