# netbox_devices (Data Source)

Query devices in NetBox using AWS-style filter blocks. Multiple `filter` blocks are ANDed; values within a filter are ORed.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Examples for the plural/query device data source.
#
# Notes:
# - Multiple `filter` blocks are ANDed together.
# - Multiple values inside one filter block are ORed together.
# - `custom_field` and `custom_field_value` are applied client-side against returned `custom_fields`.
# - The datasource returns `ids`, `names`, and `devices` (list of `{id,name}` objects).

# Example: Exact match by name
data "netbox_devices" "by_name" {
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["my-device-01"]
  }
}

output "devices_by_name_ids" {
  value = data.netbox_devices.by_name.ids
}

output "devices_by_name_names" {
  value = data.netbox_devices.by_name.names
}

output "devices_by_name_objects" {
  value = data.netbox_devices.by_name.devices
}

# Example: Case-insensitive match by name
# Useful when you don't control casing of device names.
data "netbox_devices" "by_name_ic" {
  filter {
    name   = "name__ic"
    values = ["my-device-01"]
  }
}

# Example: Multiple values in one filter (OR)
# Matches devices named either "edge-01" OR "edge-02".
data "netbox_devices" "by_multiple_names" {
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["edge-01", "edge-02"]
  }
}

# Example: Multiple filters (AND)
# Matches devices that are active AND in a specific site (by site slug).
data "netbox_devices" "by_status_and_site" {
  filter {
    name   = "status"
    values = ["active"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "site"
    values = ["nyc"]
  }
}

# Example: Filter by tag (by tag slug)
# Matches devices with the tag "production".
data "netbox_devices" "by_tag" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag"
    values = ["production"]
  }
}

# Example: Custom field existence (custom_field)
# Matches devices that have a value set for the given custom field key.
data "netbox_devices" "by_custom_field_exists" {
  filter {
    name   = "custom_field"
    values = ["asset_tag"]
  }
}

# Example: Custom field value (custom_field_value)
# Value format is "<custom_field_key>=<value>".
data "netbox_devices" "by_custom_field_value" {
  filter {
    name   = "custom_field_value"
    values = ["asset_tag=ABC123"]
  }
}

# Example: Free-text search (q)
# NetBox's search behavior depends on server version/config.
# This is commonly useful for quick discovery and may match across multiple fields.
data "netbox_devices" "by_q" {
  filter {
    name   = "q"
    values = ["datasource-test-value"]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `filter` (Block Set) Filter criteria. At least one filter must be provided. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--filter))

### Read-Only

- `devices` (Attributes List) List of matching devices as objects containing `id` and `name`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
- `ids` (List of String) List of device IDs that match the query.
- `names` (List of String) Best-effort list of device names that match the query.

### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- `name` (String) Filter key name (e.g. `name`, `name__ic`, `serial`, `status`, `site`, `tag`, `q`, `custom_field`, `custom_field_value`).
- `values` (List of String) List of values for this filter.
