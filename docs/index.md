# netbox Provider

The Netbox provider is used to interact with Netbox, an open-source web application designed to help manage and document computer networks. This provider allows you to manage Netbox resources such as sites, devices, racks, IP addresses, and more using Terraform.

## Authentication

The Netbox provider requires an API token for authentication. You can configure the provider in several ways:

1. **Provider configuration block** (recommended for development)
2. **Environment variables** (recommended for production)

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    netbox = {
      source = "bab3l/netbox"
    }
  }
}

provider "netbox" {
  server_url = "https://netbox.example.com"
  api_token  = "your-api-token-here"
  # insecure = true  # Only for testing with self-signed certificates
}
```
