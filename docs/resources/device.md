# netbox_device (Resource)

Manages a device in Netbox. Devices represent physical or virtual hardware in your infrastructure, such as servers, switches, routers, and other network equipment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_site" "test" {
  name   = "Test Site"
  slug   = "test-site"
  status = "active"
}

resource "netbox_manufacturer" "test" {
  name = "Test Manufacturer"
  slug = "test-manufacturer"
}

resource "netbox_device_type" "test" {
  model        = "Test Model"
  slug         = "test-model"
  manufacturer = netbox_manufacturer.test.id
  u_height     = 1
}

resource "netbox_device_role" "test" {
  name  = "Test Role"
  slug  = "test-role"
  color = "ff0000"
}

resource "netbox_device" "test" {
  name        = "test-device-1"
  device_type = netbox_device_type.test.id
  role        = netbox_device_role.test.id
  site        = netbox_site.test.id
  status      = "active"

  serial    = "1234567890"
  asset_tag = "asset-123"
}
```
