# netbox_device_type (Resource)

Manages a device type in Netbox. Device types define the make and model of physical hardware, including specifications like rack height, airflow direction, and weight. Device types serve as templates when creating new devices.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_manufacturer" "test" {
  name = "Test Manufacturer"
  slug = "test-manufacturer"
}

resource "netbox_device_type" "test" {
  model         = "Test Model"
  slug          = "test-model"
  manufacturer  = netbox_manufacturer.test.id
  u_height      = 1
  is_full_depth = true
  description   = "1U network switch"
  comments      = "Standard datacenter ToR switch model"

  # Partial custom fields management
  # Only specified custom fields are managed, others in NetBox preserved
  custom_fields = [
    {
      name  = "power_supply_type"
      value = "redundant-ac"
    },
    {
      name  = "max_power_draw_watts"
      value = "150"
    },
    {
      name  = "port_count"
      value = "48"
    },
    {
      name  = "end_of_life_date"
      value = "2028-12-31"
    }
  ]

  tags = [
    "network-switch",
    "1u"
  ]
}

# Optional: seed owned custom fields during import
import {
  to = netbox_device_type.test
  id = "123"

  identity = {
    custom_fields = [
      "power_supply_type:text",
      "max_power_draw_watts:integer",
      "port_count:integer",
      "end_of_life_date:date",
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `manufacturer` (String) ID or slug of the manufacturer of this device type. Required.
- `model` (String) Model name/number of the device type.
- `slug` (String) URL-friendly identifier for the device type. Must be unique and contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.

### Optional

- `airflow` (String) Direction of airflow through the device. Valid values: 'front-to-rear', 'rear-to-front', 'left-to-right', 'right-to-left', 'side-to-rear', 'passive', 'mixed'.
- `comments` (String) Additional comments or notes about the device type. Supports Markdown formatting.
- `custom_fields` (Attributes Set) Custom fields assigned to this resource. Custom fields must be defined in Netbox before use. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--custom_fields))
- `default_platform` (String) ID or slug of the default platform for devices of this type.
- `description` (String) Description of the device type.
- `exclude_from_utilization` (Boolean) If true, devices of this type are excluded when calculating rack utilization. Defaults to false.
- `is_full_depth` (Boolean) If true, device consumes both front and rear rack faces. Defaults to true.
- `part_number` (String) Discrete manufacturer part number for ordering/inventory purposes.
- `subdevice_role` (String) Role of this device type as a subdevice. Valid values: 'parent' or 'child'. Leave empty if not a subdevice.
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags assigned to this resource. Tags must already exist in Netbox.
- `u_height` (Number) Height of the device in rack units (U). Defaults to 1.0. Use 0 for devices that don't consume rack space.
- `weight` (Number) Weight of the device (use with weight_unit).
- `weight_unit` (String) Unit for weight measurement. Valid values: 'kg', 'g', 'lb', 'oz'.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the device type (assigned by Netbox).

<a id="nestedatt--custom_fields"></a>
### Nested Schema for `custom_fields`

Required:

- `name` (String) Name of the custom field.
- `type` (String) Type of the custom field (text, longtext, integer, boolean, date, url, json, select, multiselect, object, multiobject).
- `value` (String) Value of the custom field.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Device Types can be imported by ID
terraform import netbox_device_type.test 123
```
