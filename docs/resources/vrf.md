# netbox_vrf (Resource)

Manages a VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding) instance in Netbox. VRFs are used to implement virtual routing tables, enabling multiple routing instances to coexist within the same network infrastructure. They are commonly used to provide network isolation for different customers, departments, or network functions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "netbox_route_target" "import" {
  name = "65000:100"
}

resource "netbox_route_target" "export" {
  name = "65000:200"
}

resource "netbox_vrf" "test" {
  name           = "Test VRF"
  rd             = "65000:1"
  description    = "Customer VRF for multi-tenant network"
  comments       = "Isolated routing table for customer traffic"
  import_targets = [netbox_route_target.import.id]
  export_targets = [netbox_route_target.export.id]

  # Partial custom fields management
  # Only specified custom fields are managed, others in NetBox preserved
  custom_fields = [
    {
      name  = "customer_name"
      value = "Acme Corporation"
    },
    {
      name  = "vrf_type"
      value = "customer"
    },
    {
      name  = "import_policy"
      value = "65000:100"
    },
    {
      name  = "export_policy"
      value = "65000:200"
    }
  ]

  tags = [
    "customer-vrf",
    "production"
  ]
}

# Optional: seed owned custom fields during import
import {
  to = netbox_vrf.test
  id = "123"

  identity = {
    custom_fields = [
      "customer_name:text",
      "vrf_type:text",
      "import_policy:text",
      "export_policy:text",
    ]
  }
}
```
