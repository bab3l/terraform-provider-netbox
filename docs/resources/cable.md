# netbox_cable (Resource)

Manages a cable connection between two endpoints in Netbox. Cables represent physical connections between interfaces, ports, or circuit terminations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a cable between two interfaces
# Cables represent physical connections in Netbox

# Prerequisites: You need to have devices with interfaces already created
# This example assumes you have two interfaces to connect

resource "netbox_cable" "example" {
  # A-side termination - specify the object type and ID
  a_terminations = [{
    object_type = "dcim.interface"
    object_id   = 1 # ID of interface on first device
  }]

  # B-side termination - specify the object type and ID
  b_terminations = [{
    object_type = "dcim.interface"
    object_id   = 2 # ID of interface on second device
  }]

  # Cable type - common values: cat5e, cat6, cat6a, mmf, smf
  type = "cat6a"

  # Status of the connection
  status = "connected"

  # Physical label on the cable
  label = "PATCH-001"

  # Color code (hex format)
  color = "0000ff"

  # Cable length with unit
  length      = 5.5
  length_unit = "m"

  # Documentation
  description = "Patch cable from switch to server"
  comments    = "Installed during data center buildout"

  # Partial custom fields management
  # Only specified custom fields are managed, others in NetBox preserved
  custom_fields = [
